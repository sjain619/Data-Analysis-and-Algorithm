I have written all parts separately, each code runs independently. Here,

coolsort.cpp is the code for problem2. On running the makefile we can use ./coolsort to run the code.

question5.cpp is the implementation of the algorithm written in question5. On running the makefile we can use ./question5 to run the code.

selection.cpp is the implementation of selection sort as discribed in Problem1.On running the makefile we can use ./selection to run the code.

please use :
